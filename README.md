# Sudo Compiler For N (Ugly Mess) ps. Only works with the print statements and non-returning functions right now. Must use Compile.bat in cmd (Windows) or Compile.sh in terminal (Linux/Mac), with the jar file in the same folder, to use. ```Compile.bat %filename%.n```

## The N Language
---
The N Language was a language that I tried to design that took inspiration from swift, python and java.

<br />

## Syntax
---
### Functions

A function in the N language uses the key word of ```func``` followed by the name of the function and parameters. All N files must have a main function

```swift
func main() {
    // Some Code
}
```

```swift
func funcName() {
    // Some Code
}

func setVar(x) {
    // Some Code
}
```

A function that has a return:

```swift
func get() : int {
    // Some Code
    return x;
}
func get() : char {
    // Some Code
    return x;
}
func get() : string {
    // Some Code
    return x;
}
func get() : boolean {
    // Some Code
    return x;
}
```

### Variables

Variables start with either the keyword ```var``` or ```let``` (for constants)(Use able variable types: string, char, int, boolean).

```swift
var x;
let y = 5;
x = 3;
var z = y + x;
```

### Conditionals

The if statement:

```swift
if true {
    // Some Code
}
```

### Loops

The while loop:

```swift
while true {
    // Some Code
}
```

The for loop:

```swift
for i 0 to 10 {
    // Some Code
}
```

The for each loop:

```vba
foreach c in s {
    // Some Code
}
```

### Printing output

To print output into the console, there are three methods that can be used:

```swift
print(var);
println();
println(var);
printf("%d%f%s%n", var);
```

Escape sequences will also work with these print statements ```\n```, ```\t```, ```\\```, ```\'``` and ```\"```.
